/**
 * PollsDashboard
 *
 * This page displays all polls created by the authenticated user,
 * along with their vote counts. It acts as the central hub for poll
 * management, allowing users to view existing polls and navigate to
 * create new ones.
 *
 * Why it's needed:
 * - Serves as the main "dashboard" where users can manage their polls.
 * - Provides visibility into existing polls and their popularity
 *   (measured by vote counts).
 * - Offers a clear path for creating new polls.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The user is already authenticated (via `useAuth`).
 * - The `polls` table in Supabase contains `id`, `question`, and `created_at`.
 * - The `votes` table is set up with a relation to `polls` so that
 *   Supabase can return aggregated counts with `.select("votes(count)")`.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 * - If Supabase returns an error, the dashboard still renders but
 *   without polls (error is logged in the console).
 * - If there are no polls, a message is displayed instead of empty UI.
 * - While loading, a spinner/message is shown to avoid flicker.
 *
 * Connections:
 * - Relies on `PollCard` to display individual poll details.
 * - Relies on `AuthContext` to know whether to link "Create New Poll"
 *   to the poll creation page or the login page.
 * - Integrates directly with Supabase for persistent data.

export default function PollsDashboard() {
  const { user } = useAuth(); // Access logged-in user state from global context

  useEffect(() => {
    /**
     * fetchPolls
     *
     * Fetches all polls from the Supabase `polls` table, including
     * aggregated vote counts, and normalizes them into a format
     * the UI can consume.
     *
     * Why it's needed:
     * - Central data-fetching function that populates the dashboard.
     * - Ensures votes are flattened into a simple `vote_count` number,
     *   since Supabase returns nested results.
     *
     * Assumptions:
     * - Supabase connection is correctly configured in `supabaseClient`.
     * - The `votes` relation is properly set up with `polls`.
     *
     * Edge Cases:
     * - If Supabase fails, logs error and leaves `polls` empty.
     * - Ensures `vote_count` defaults to 0 if a poll has no votes yet.
     *
     * Connections:
     * - Data feeds directly into `PollCard` components for rendering.
