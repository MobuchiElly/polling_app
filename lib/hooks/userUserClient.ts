/**
 * Custom Hook: useUserClient
 *
 * Provides a convenience wrapper around Supabase queries that are scoped
 * to the currently authenticated user. By combining `useAuth` with
 * Supabase queries, it ensures we never fetch user-specific data unless
 * the user is logged in.
 *
 * Why it's needed:
 * - Centralizes the logic of "only fetch polls for the logged-in user."
 * - Prevents duplicate logic (auth + query) across multiple components.
 * - Makes components simpler by hiding Supabase query details inside the hook.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - `useAuth` returns a valid `user` object when logged in, otherwise `null`.
 * - Supabase is properly configured and the "polls" table has a `created_by` field
 *   that matches the `user.id` from Auth.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 * - If `user` is not logged in, `fetchPolls` will throw immediately.
 *   Consumers of this hook must handle that error gracefully.
 * - If Supabase returns an error, itâ€™s passed through so components can handle it.
 *
 * Connections:
 * - Intended to be used in dashboard or profile-related pages where the app
 *   needs to display polls created by the logged-in user.
 * - Relies on `AuthContext` (for user state) and `supabaseClient` (for queries).
